# Multi Nominal Logit Models Using Python

Multi Nominal Logit (MNL) models are often applied in urban research to predict the likelihood of particular choices. For example, a MNL model can be used to predict mode choice behavior, based on characteristics of individuals. 

In this tutorial we will use ```Pandas```, ```Numpy```, ```sklearn``` and ```Plotly``` to estimate a MNL model and present the results. You can download and install these packages manually using pip if you. If you are using the Anaconda distribution of Python, you will find most of them installed already. Alternatively, you can consider using [this virtual environment setup](https://dataaspirant.com/2016/03/22/python-datamining-packages-virtual-environment-setup-in-ubuntu/) for data mining.
